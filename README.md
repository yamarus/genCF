# GenCF 
is a successful approach for the generation of partially fluorinated graphene structures.

A computationally simple model optimized on a large DFT dataset quickly and precisely  predicts experimentally observed structures.
Detailed description of the metod is presented in R. D. Yamaletdinov, Y. A. Nikiforov, L. G. Bulusheva, and A. V. Okotrub, “Fluorine patterning of graphene: Effects of fluorine content and temperature,” ([arXiv:2007.14765](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.14765)).
